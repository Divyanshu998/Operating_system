Join the Movement: Collaborative Open-Source Operating System 🌟

We're building an innovative, community-driven operating system, and we invite you to contribute! 🤝

Technical Foundation

💻 Kernel Design
Monolithic, microkernel, or hybrid: choose the best approach for performance, security, and modularity.
System calls for process management, memory management, file handling, and hardware interaction.
Efficient memory allocation and management (paging/segmentation).

Process Scheduling
Multitasking and prioritization for optimal performance.
Concurrency and multithreading support.

File System 📁
File management (creation, deletion, reading, writing).
Support for multiple file systems (EXT4, FAT, NTFS).
Permissions and security for access control.

Driver Support 🚗
Hardware drivers for network, storage, graphics, input devices, etc.
Open-source drivers for community contribution.
Device abstraction layer for simplicity and flexibility.

User Interface 📱
Command Line Interface (CLI) for basic interaction.
Modular Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendliness.

Networking 📡
Networking stack (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.).
Security features (encryption, secure communication).
Open-source contribution platform.

Security and Access Control 🔒
User authentication (password, biometrics).
Cryptographic support.
Patch management for easy updates.

Build and Development Tools 🛠
Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
Version control (Git).

Community and Documentation 📚
Contributing guide.
Issue tracker.
Developer documentation.

Testing Framework 🧪
Unit testing and integration testing.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
